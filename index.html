  <h3>Familiarize Yourself:<h3>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div>
  First thing in becoming a pro-gamer......is just the same of any other skill. It requires you to do research. If you have a favorite game you'd like to stream try watching streamers stream that game on Mixer or Twitch.
  And don't worry if you don't have all the gear that pro-streamers and gamers have. Often times, that takes a while and as we know, gamer gear is very expensive.
</div>
  Try watching minor streamers, not only is it a good start, but it gives you an idea of how you will be starting off.
<div>
  <p>
  Another good way to familiarize yourself is through chatting with other people like you.
  A good way to do that is to join clubs.
</div>
</p>
  <p>
  Here are some examples of streaming websites:
    <a href ="https://www.twitch.com">Twitch,</a>
    <a href ="https://www.mixer.com">Mixer</a>
  </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
  Some good community websites to discuss:
    <a href ="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit,</a>
    <a href ="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/xbox-live/join-club">Xbox Clubs</a>
  </p>
  </div>


<div>
  <p>
   <h3>Join Youtube, Twitch, Or Mixer:</h3>
</p>
</div>

  The next step in jumpstarting your career is to make a streamer account! This is the most important step because where else would yu stream?
  A tip for creating your account is to make your username, or the name that everyone sees, your gamertag, or a gamer name most known you as. If you don't, most people will get confused on who you are.
<div>
  After joining make sure to upload at least once or twice a week, or stream, otherwise you won't get new watchers and subscribers to your channel.
</div>
<p>
  Have Fun and Be Creative!!!:
</p>
  Lastly, be creative and have fun! People naturally gravitate to people who they think are funny and know how to have a good time.
  When you watch streams take notes of what you like and dislike....and make sure to keep those things in mind.

<p>
  Some tips would be:
</p>
<div>
  To plan some of your streams, like what games you plan to stream
</div>
  Make sure to check the chat of your stream to see what the watchers and saying and maybe address some questions if they have some
<div>
  Be yourself, nobody likes a copy, and there is only one of you in the world right?
</div>
  And remember, TRUE success only comes to those who work for it, so make sure to dedicate time!
